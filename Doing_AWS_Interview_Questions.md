96. **Q: What’s the difference between instance store and EBS?**

    **Issue**

    I’m not sure whether to store the data associated with my Amazon EC2 instance in instance store or  in an attached Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Which option is best for me?

    - **Ans:** **Resolution**

    Some Amazon EC2 instance types come with a form of directly attached, block-device storage known as the instance store. The instance store is ideal for temporary storage, because the data stored in instance store volumes is not persistent through instance stops, terminations, or hardware failures. You can find more detailed information about the instance store at Amazon EC2 Instance Store.

    For data you want to retain longer-term, or if you need to encrypt the data, we recommend using EBS volumes instead. EBS volumes preserve their data through instance stops and terminations, can be easily backed up with EBS snapshots, can be removed from instances and reattached to another, and support full-volume encryption. For more detailed information about EBS volumes, see Features of Amazon EBS.

**2. Explain the purpose of IAM in AWS.**

- **Answer:** The purpose of IAM is to provide a centralized system for managing access to AWS services and resources. It allows you to create and control users, assign specific permissions, and define roles with specific privileges, enhancing security and compliance in your AWS environment.

**3. What are IAM users, groups, and roles?**

- **Answer:**
  - **IAM Users:** IAM users are individual entities associated with an AWS account. Each user has unique credentials and permissions that define what actions they can perform within the account.
  - **Groups:** Groups are collections of IAM users. By placing users into groups, you can assign common permissions to multiple users at once, simplifying access management.
  - **Roles:** IAM roles are sets of permissions that define what actions an entity (e.g., an AWS service or a user from another AWS account) can perform. Roles do not have their own permanent set of credentials; they are assumed by trusted entities.

**4. How do you secure your AWS account with IAM?**

- **Answer:** To secure an AWS account with IAM, you should:
  - Implement strong password policies and require multi-factor authentication (MFA).
  - Regularly review and audit user permissions to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege.
  - Avoid sharing long-term access keys and instead use IAM roles for temporary access.
  - Enable CloudTrail to monitor and log all API activities.
  - Use IAM policies and resource-based policies to control access to AWS resources.

**5. How do you grant permissions to an IAM user?**

- **Answer:** Permissions are granted by attaching policies to IAM users. You can attach policies directly to a user or add them to a group that the user belongs to. Policies define the specific actions that a user is allowed or denied.

**6. Explain the concept of IAM policies.**

- **Answer:** IAM policies are JSON documents that define permissions and actions. They specify what actions are allowed or denied on AWS resources. Policies can be attached to IAM users, groups, or roles to grant or restrict access.

**7. What are the different types of IAM policies?**

- **Answer:** There are two main types of IAM policies:
  - **Managed Policies:** These are standalone policies that you can attach to multiple users, groups, or roles. They can be AWS managed (created and managed by AWS) or customer managed (created and managed by you).
  - **Inline Policies:** These are policies that are embedded directly into a user, group, or role. They are created and managed directly on the user, group, or role itself.

**8. What is the principle of least privilege in IAM?**

- **Answer:** The principle of least privilege means granting the minimum level of access or permissions necessary for a user, group, or role to perform their required tasks. This reduces the potential impact of a security breach or misuse of permissions.

**9. How do you manage access keys for IAM users?**

- **Answer:** Access keys consist of an access key ID and a secret access key. You can manage access keys for IAM users by creating, rotating, and deleting them through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs. It's recommended to regularly rotate access keys for enhanced security.

**10. What is MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) in IAM?**
    - **Answer:** MFA is an additional layer of security that requires users to provide two or more forms of authentication before gaining access to AWS resources. This typically involves something the user knows (e.g., a password) and something they possess (e.g., a physical MFA device or a mobile app).

**11. Explain IAM roles for EC2 instances.**
    - **Answer:** IAM roles for EC2 instances allow EC2 instances to assume a role and obtain temporary security credentials. This eliminates the need to store long-term credentials on an EC2 instance. Roles are attached to an EC2 instance during launch.

**12. What is IAM federation?**
    - **Answer:** IAM federation allows you to integrate your existing identity system with AWS, enabling users to access AWS resources using their existing credentials. This can be achieved through federation services like AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) or third-party identity providers.

**13. What is the IAM policy evaluation logic?**
    - **Answer:** IAM policy evaluation follows the "deny by default" principle. If there are no policies explicitly allowing an action, it is denied. Policies can be attached to users, groups, roles, or resources. The most specific policy (with the least privilege) is applied.

**14. How do you create a custom IAM policy?**
    - **Answer:** To create a custom IAM policy, you can do so through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. You write the policy in JSON format, specifying the actions, resources, and conditions. Once created, you can attach it to users, groups, or roles.

**15. What is IAM condition element in a policy?**
    - **Answer:** Conditions in IAM policies allow you to control when a policy is in effect. They are expressed as key-value pairs, and they can be used to limit access based on various factors such as time, source IP, and more.

**16. How do you rotate access keys for an IAM user?**
    - **Answer:** You can rotate access keys for an IAM user by creating a new access key, updating applications or services to use the new key, and then deleting the old access key. This ensures a seamless transition without interrupting access.

**17. What is IAM policy versioning?**
    - **Answer:** IAM policy versioning allows you to have multiple versions of a policy. When you update a policy, AWS creates a new version while keeping the old versions intact. This enables you to maintain backward compatibility and roll back changes if needed.

**18. How can you monitor IAM events and activities?**
    - **Answer:** You can monitor IAM events and activities by enabling AWS CloudTrail, which records all API calls made on your account. CloudTrail logs can be analyzed to track IAM activities and events.

**19. What is AWS Organizations and how does it relate to IAM?**
    - **Answer:** AWS Organizations is a service that allows you to centrally manage and govern multiple AWS accounts. It helps you consolidate billing, apply policies across accounts, and simplify management. IAM is used within each individual account, while AWS Organizations provides management at the organizational level.

**20. How do you troubleshoot IAM permission issues?**
    - **Answer:** Troubleshooting IAM permission issues involves checking policies, roles, and group memberships to ensure that the user has the necessary permissions. CloudTrail logs can be reviewed to identify any denied actions and diagnose the issue.

    *Answer:* A Site-to-Site VPN connection connects your on-premises network to your VPC over an encrypted Virtual Private Gateway (VGW) or Direct Connect.
22. **When would you use a Site-to-Site VPN connection?**
    *Answer:* Site-to-Site VPN is used when you need secure communication between your on-premises network and your AWS resources, but don't want to expose them to the public internet.
23. **What information is needed to establish a Site-to-Site VPN connection?**
    *Answer:* To establish a Site-to-Site VPN connection, you need the public IP address of your customer gateway, the pre-shared key, and the BGP ASN (if using BGP).

### VPC Endpoints:

24. **What is a VPC endpoint?**
    *Answer:* A VPC endpoint allows you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by AWS PrivateLink.
25. **How does a VPC endpoint enhance security for accessing AWS services?**
    *Answer:* A VPC endpoint allows you to access AWS services without going over the internet. This keeps traffic within the AWS network and enhances security.
26. **What types of VPC endpoints are available?**
    *Answer:* There are two types of VPC endpoints: Interface Endpoints (powered by AWS PrivateLink) and Gateway Endpoints. Interface Endpoints are for AWS services, and Gateway Endpoints are for S3 and DynamoDB.

### Routing in a VPC:

27. **How does routing work within a VPC?**
    *Answer:* Each subnet in a VPC has a route table associated with it. The route table specifies how traffic is directed in and out of the subnet. Routes can point to the internet gateway, Virtual Private Gateway, NAT Gateway, or VPC peering connection.
28. **What is the purpose of a route table in a VPC?**
    *Answer:* A route table in a VPC determines where network traffic is directed. It specifies the next hop for traffic based on its destination.
29. **Can you associate multiple route tables with a subnet?**
    *Answer:* Yes, you can associate multiple route tables with a subnet. However, only one route table can be the main route table for a subnet.

### Elastic IP Addresses:

30. **What is an Elastic IP (EIP) in the context of VPC?**
    *Answer:* An Elastic IP is a static, public IPv4 address that you can allocate to your AWS account. It's designed for dynamic cloud computing to ensure that the IP address of your EC2 instance doesn't change if the instance is stopped or terminated.
31. **How do you associate an Elastic IP with an EC2 instance in a VPC?**
    *Answer:* You can associate an Elastic IP with an EC2 instance using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs. Once associated, the Elastic IP becomes the public IPv4 address of the instance.

### Direct Connect:

32. **What is AWS Direct Connect and how does it relate to VPC?**
    *Answer:* AWS Direct Connect is a network service that provides dedicated network connections from your on-premises data centers to AWS. It's often used to establish a private and reliable connection between on-premises networks and AWS VPCs.
33. **When would you use Direct Connect instead of VPN connections?**
    *Answer:* Direct Connect is preferred over VPN connections when you require higher bandwidth, lower latency, or a dedicated network connection to AWS. It's especially useful for mission-critical and data-intensive applications.

### Flow Logs:

34. **What are VPC Flow Logs?**
    *Answer:* VPC Flow Logs capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. They provide detailed information, including source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
35. **How are Flow Logs useful for network troubleshooting and security analysis?**
    *Answer:* Flow Logs can be analyzed to troubleshoot network connectivity issues, monitor traffic patterns, and identify potential security risks or unusual activity in your VPC.

### NAT Gateways and NAT Instances:

36. **What is the purpose of a NAT Gateway in a VPC?**
    *Answer:* A NAT Gateway allows resources in a private subnet to connect to the internet, while preventing inbound traffic initiated from the internet. It's used for instances that need to download updates or access external resources.
37. **How does a NAT Gateway differ from a NAT instance?**
    *Answer:* A NAT Gateway is a managed AWS service that provides high availability and automatic scaling. A NAT instance is a manually configured EC2 instance that acts as a NAT device. NAT Gateways are recommended for most use cases due to their simplicity and scalability.

### VPC Endpoints for S3:

38. **What is a VPC endpoint for S3?**
    *Answer:* A VPC endpoint for S3 allows you to access Amazon S3 from your VPC without going over the internet. It provides a private connection to S3, enhancing security and performance.
39. **How does it allow secure access to S3 without going over the internet?**
    *Answer:* The VPC endpoint for S3 routes traffic directly from your VPC to S3 over the Amazon network. This keeps the traffic within the AWS network and avoids exposure to the public internet.

### VPC Security Best Practices:

40. **What are some best practices for securing a VPC?**
    *Answer:* Some best practices include using security groups and NACLs effectively, minimizing exposure of resources to the public internet, using VPC flow logs for monitoring, and implementing encryption for data in transit and at rest.
41. **How can you prevent public exposure of resources in a VPC?**
    *Answer:* You can prevent public exposure by placing resources in private subnets without direct internet access, and using NAT Gateways or instances for outbound internet access. Additionally, use Security Groups and NACLs to control inbound and outbound traffic.

### VPC Endpoints for DynamoDB:

42. **What is a VPC endpoint for DynamoDB?**
    *Answer:* A VPC endpoint for DynamoDB allows you to access Amazon DynamoDB from your VPC without going over the internet. It provides a private connection to DynamoDB, enhancing security and performance.
43. **How does it allow secure access to DynamoDB without going over the internet?**
    *Answer:* The VPC endpoint for DynamoDB routes traffic directly from your VPC to DynamoDB over the Amazon network. This keeps the traffic within the AWS network and avoids exposure to the public internet.

### VPC Limits:

44. **Are there any limitations or quotas on VPC resources?**
    *Answer:* Yes, there are various limits on VPC resources, such as the maximum number of VPCs per region, the maximum number of subnets per VPC, and the maximum number of Elastic IP addresses per account, among others. These limits can be found in the AWS documentation.
